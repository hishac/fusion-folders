# Fusion Folders

A personal collection of folders for the [Fusion](https://apps.apple.com/app/fusion-tv/id6471556076) app.

## Usage

1. In Fusion, go to the Folders section and import the `folders.json` file.
2. The posters used are already uploaded in this repo, but youâ€™re free to host them yourself if you prefer..

## Notes

- This is just a personal setup. Feel free to use it.
- Not all posters were created by me, this is for personal use only.
- Posters are kept lightweight for performance, but still high enough quality to look good on TV.
