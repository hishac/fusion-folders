# Fusion Folders

A personal collection of folders for the [Fusion](https://apps.apple.com/app/fusion-tv/id6471556076) Apple TV app.

## Usage

1. In Fusion, go to the Folders section and import the `folders.json` file.
2. Make sure image URLs are accessible. You can host the images directly from GitHub using raw links or upload them elsewhere.

## Notes

- This is just a personal setup. Feel free to use it.
- Images are kept lightweight for performance, but still high enough quality to look good on TV.
